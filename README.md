# Orbital Mechanics Simulation

A simple 2D orbital mechanics simulation using Python and Pygame.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Simulation

Run the main script:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Controls

- `ESC`: Quit the application
- `Arrow Keys`: Adjust velocity of the primary satellite
- `C`: Add a new circular orbit
- `E`: Add a new elliptical orbit
- GUI Buttons:
  - Pause/Play: Toggle simulation
  - Speed: Cycle through time scales (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
  - Reset: Reset the simulation

## Simplified Implementation

This project has been simplified from the original spec and focuses on:

1. Basic orbital mechanics with simplified physics
2. Simple 2D visualization
3. Minimal UI controls
4. Preset orbital scenarios
